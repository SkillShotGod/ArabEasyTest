The following app has been made for the interview trial of ArabEasy. Instead of using a mock server or normal context file for user, we are instead hitting an open source mock API for getting our data to emulate asynchronous functionality the best we can. There is a lot of things used in here that you probably wouldnt use in an ideal app like prop drilling upto the extend I displayed, but it is for the sole purpose of visiting everything I could think of in one small Project. I tried using redux the best of my knowledge, we could use the middlewares more in order to do more with the data but since it looks like more of a UI test, I didn't go too deep into it. I tried to structure the project upto some extent as well.
